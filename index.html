Biomedical Waste is one the major issues to tackle in urban life. Any waste which is generated during the diagnosis, treatment or immunization of human beings or animals or in research activities pertaining thereto or in the production or testing needs to be taken care of with proper treatment flawless planning and acute implementation of work-flow.
